Last week was the first day of my doctoral studies, something I've never imagined to do ten years ago. It's always fun to think about what your past self thought about what you'd do. And then life happens, gives you unforeseen paths with more or less control, like swimming in the stream of a river.

Long ago, I wanted to write a personal blog and then came the obvious question: what to write? The latter left my Gatsby blog template in desolation.

Today, I think this new stage of study is a great occasion to start this web page. I wish to share some ideas, some work and to finally satisfy my envy to write more.

Enjoy
