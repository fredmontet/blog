Yesterday I watched The Castle in the Sky, a film from Hayao Miyazaki produced in 1986. This is his third movie, he was 45 at that time. The scenario is quite interesting as it resonates with many concerns our world has nowadays. One in particular is the relationship between nature and technology.

Seated in a train, cruising at more than 100 km/h to go study in [HEIA-FR](https://www.heia-fr.ch/), I'm looking at the falling rain and my mind gets busy with a few technical questions. The field in front of the window is green with a few clouds caught by its hills. In an instant, a big coffee factory appears. The world seems to feel better without the industrial giants... 

Such a clear cut from one world to the other doesn't look like a symbiosis. It looks like a disrespect of a nature that brought us everything we have. It looks like we have no respect. It looks like the product of technological evolution serves the industrial optimization to a mesmerizing level. And I wonder: does it stops? We, Homo sapiens, are we able to be as wise as we call us?

In this burning world, shouting all it can how we destroy it (cf.[MeteoSwiss](https://www.meteosuisse.admin.ch/home.subpage.html/fr/data/blogs/2020/1/2019--deuxieme-annee-la-plus-chaude.html)), will the wisdom of humanity be strong enough to overcome the desire of growth of everyone?
