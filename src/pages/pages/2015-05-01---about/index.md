Media and computer science engineer, what does it **mean** exactly? ü§î

After an apprenticeship in mechatronics at [Bobst Group](https://www.bobst.com), I realized that the need for machinery was overhead to my will of simplicity. Solely relying on a computer to work seemed like heaven to my eyes.

That's why I started a Bachelor in _Print and Interactive Media Management_ at [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/). Once those studies were over, I worked as a paragliding tandem pilot to relax my mind. Then, I completed a Master in _Information and Communication Technologies_ at [HES-SO](https://www.hes-so.ch/). 

Today, I'm a PhD student in [HEIA-FR](https://www.heia-fr.ch) with Prof. Jean Hennebert and I study ways to reduce building energy consumption.

Through this website, I hope that I'll be able to transfer you my deepest passions: flying, computer science and learning.

Fr√©d√©ric
