Media and computer science engineer, what does it mean exactly? After a apprenticeship in mechatronics at [Bobst Group](https://www.bobst.com), I realized that the need of machinery and heavy tools to work was an overhead to my will of simplicity. Solely relying on a computer to be able to work seemed like heaven to my eyes.

This is why I started to study a Bachelor in _Print and Interactive Media Management_ at [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/). Once those studies were over, I worked as a paragliding tandem pilot and tried to relaxed my mind; it didn't happened. The winter was calmly passing by, and I was learning computer science by myself. To me, it was a clear message that the student life wasn't over yet. Hence why I started a Master in _Information and Communication Technologies_ at [HES-SO](https://www.hes-so.ch/). 

Today, those studies are over. I thought my will to learn would partially vanish but, once again I was wrong; it did increase. Through the articles of this website, I hope that I'll be able to transfer you my deepest passions: flying, computer science and learning.
